# Manuscript and Surix recap and progress over the last year

I'm resuming classes tonight after a break of almost 4 months. I took the break in part so that I could focus more on Surix, re-learn C and C++ and practice ML. In the first two months, I had all the momentum, but in the following 2 months I slowed down a bit. While I did not accomplish everything I had set out to, the highlight achievement during this period was definitely launching the first Surix MVP close to the end of June.

Launching the MVP was major milestone for Manuscript. With this single feat we had achieved more than we had in 2018. Last year the company struggled to find direction and to make consistent progress. At the end of last year it was clear that major changes needed to be made.

I had a lot of doubts last year about the product we were building, about whether it was the right thing to do, about whether we were on the right track, whether our approach was the right one. This affected my ability to make decisions and to provide direction to the rest of the team and many a times I did not seem to know where we going. I would experience bursts of confidence after an idea or eureka moment, but then question myself into doubt. I also thought too much about being perceived as a bad leader, or a being too bossy or dictatorial. This was another impediment to effective decision-making. I hesitated to make tough calls as a result, hesitated to call people out when I had to, I let mediocrity pass almost unchecked. My fear of being perceived as a bad leader actually made me a bad leader. And it was the most frustrating period for me.

Being decisive was the major resolution I made in 2019. To that effect I started the year making some tough calls, first was let go of people who were part of AM on paper but not part of it in practice. Then Kevin eventually got another job and we needed a replacement full-time developer. Luckily, Mahirwe happened to be available to take a full-time gig at this point. I had been eyeing him for a while and we had spoken about the potential of him working on Surix part-time. But in an unfortunate serendipity, he was able to take the gig full-time. Kevin remained involved in the company, mainly by contributing towards Mahirwe's pay. Although I hesitated to make the call for a long time, it turned out to work well for everyone. Kevin got a better job and ironically became even more committed to AM, Mahirwe got an opportunity to make money off his skills while he waits to go back to school, my sanity and hope were restored and AM got a functioning team. We were 4 now. We also decided to stay focused this year, to avoid distractions, like unnecessary PR. Last year we had tried to get speaking slots at conferences, we announced Surix at a meetup we had co-sponsored when the product was barely demonstrable.

Getting Mahirwe on board was probably the best thing to happen in the last 2 years. He has been very consistent, reliable and effective. He breathed new hope into the company, and now product development could resume. Now that the team was figured out, we had to figure out a strategy of the product. After cutting down some features, we decided to turn Surix into a BaaS-like database with a friendly interface allowing for ad-hoc analysis. This was essentially a new product yet again. I had a lot of uncertainty about the product and where it would go, especially because we didn't know where we would take it next after the MVP. But we still pressed on.

We launched the MVP a few weeks past initial schedule and we started collecting feedback.
A few people gave us very in-depth and insightful feedback. This gave us concrete ideas about what to do next and where to take the product, it gave answers to some of doubts and questions we had. We intend to release the 2nd MVP iteration in about a month of so. And we have moved away from the BaaS database idea of the first MVP and more towards a data analytics platform.

We hope that by the end of year we'll have people using the product for real work and getting value from it.

PS: I did not participate in the Zindi data science challenge I mentioned in my [last entry](2019-04-29-foray-into-deep-learning.md). I got trapped in tutorial hell trying to take the fast.ai course and lost track.
