# 2nd term in OMSCS, progress, adjustments and mindset

I'm currently taking my second course in the OMSCS program, introduction to Computer Vision.
My first course, Artificial Intelligence, gave me sleepless nights but I really enjoyed it.
It was survey course that covered various topics in AI. It gave me a better idea of
what AI is about and its different branches. I found topics such as Bayes Nets, HMMs
and Particle filters quite interesting. At least now I know the distinction between
AI and ML.

That course was also considered one of the demanding ones in the OMSCS program. I'm glad I took it
first, not only did it arouse my interests in various fields, but it also pushed me to the edge.
I became the student I always aimed at being but never was. By that I mean a student who studies on time,
starts assignments on time, etc. But I don't think I could have succeeded in the program any other way.
It prepared me for the demand and workload that I should expect from the OMSCS program.

Now I'm the middle of my second course and CV is also pushing me to the edge, so much so that I have
had to restructure my entire schedule to cope. Now I try to wake up at around 10AM, work till about 7-8PM, 
then do my school work. I sleep around 4AM. If I finish my assignments on time, I work on Envoy
or the Deep Learning course I'm also currently taking on Coursera. Since I've switched to this
plan I've remained on track, but in the first 3 weeks I struggled and had already fallen behind track. I still have some dead time that I'm trying to optimise, but I've seen a lot of gains with this new approach. Working out has been hard though.

There is one important thing I realized during this CV course. Especially in the first weeks before I made adjustments. I used to waste more time in the assignments that I needed to. I always read the assignments tasks and felt like I didn't know what to do or where to start. I would look and feel lost and finally start like after a week when I felt like I had no choice but to attempt whatever was in my mind. It's like I had some sort of mental obstacle, like my thinking was incapacitated to some extent.

When I finally got to doing the work, I would right crude, not-so-elegant implementations, but they seemed to work. It's like I had the basic idea in my head all along but my mind was rejecting it and shunning the internally-proposed solutions because they seemed crude, hacked-up and inelegant. But it seems many of the solutions in CV are like this, you have to "massage" the algorithms and sometimes use crude hacks in order for it to work properly. Maybe you can refactor later to get elegant solutions.

I mean it sounds obvious that the first implementation may not be elegant or efficient and that you can refactor and optimise once you have something working, but I don't know why my mind was rejecting such ideas without trying them, instead retreating to "I don't know where to start". I assume if I were a less experienced programmer I wouldn't have rejected such mental leads. I don't know at what point in my brief journey in computer science I degenerated to this type of thinking. Now I hope to move away from this "posh" approach to problem-solving towards a more "survival" approach, meaning to do what I have to do to solve the problem.

So I'm really glad I went through this course and that it took me to these edges and pushed me to make adjustments not only in my time, but my mindset. I hope I get more opportunities to learn and grow throughout this journey.
