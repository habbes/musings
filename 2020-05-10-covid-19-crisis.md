# Covid 19 Crisis

It has been about 2 months since the first confirmed case of Covid-19 (Corona virus) was reported in Kenya. Eventually schools and churches closed, working from home became more normal (I've gone back to working remotely, too), a curfew was imposed, movement between some cities was prohibited, some areas in Nairobi have been closed off, etc. The measures keep getting more and more extreme. People are getting seriously affected by the economic impact: pay cuts, lay-offs, unpaid leaves, small businesses not getting customers, people not being able to meet their basic needs, etc.

Since I heard that countries like Italy, Spain and France imposed nationwide lock-downs in order to contain the virus and stop the spread, I wondered whether such measures could be practically carried out here and what impact it would have on people whose income streams would be cut off due to the lock-down. We haven't had such lock-down yet, but many people are still negatively impacted.

I proposed to the team (Alpha Manuscript) that we pause the work we were doing on Surix and work on a project that could help during the crisis. The project is simply a platform where people who have the means would deposit donations, and the system would distribute the donations to people in need of financial relief to help them get through the crisis. We've been working on it for a couple of weeks now and hope to have a demonstrable proof-of-concept this coming week.

In order to get it to market, we will need to figure out how to get money effectively in and out of the system, how to identify people who are in need, how to get people to donate, how to get people to trust the system, etc. We believe that we'll need partners in order for this to succeed. We're targeting Africa's Talking as a first potential partner because they've been accessible to us in the past and because they provide the critical APIs we need (payments, SMS, USSD, etc.). We also hope to get in touch with trusted charities who may help identify people in need.

We intend to start small, getting donations from ourselves and friends first before trying to get it to the public.

We aim for the system to be transparent, trusted and effective. When people deposit their money, they should have the confidence that every shilling of it will go to people in need. People should be able to know how much money has been donated, how much has been distributed, how many people have benefited from the donations, etc. We also intend to make the source code public.

Anyway, at this point, I'm not sure whether this project will take off or go anywhere, but it's worth a try. At the end of the day, whether it succeeds or not, we'll probably go back to building Surix.

Hopefully the crisis will end soon.
