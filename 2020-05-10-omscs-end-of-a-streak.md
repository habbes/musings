# End of the A streak

About a week and a half ago, I submitted the final exam of the OMSCS Compilers course. Once again, I went to bed at around 5am, waking up for work a few hours later. I was exhausted but relieved to have completed the course. Now, the break is over, and tomorrow I'm starting my 8th course, High Performance Computing Architecture. Before I get on board the roller coaster again, I thought I should write down some reflections.

This was one of the best course I have taken in the OMSCS program so far. It was extremely rewarding and challenging. However, it's also the first course in the program where I got a B, breaking my A-streak. When I started the program, I set-out to get straight A's for the entire program. So it sucked and hurt a bit when I failed this time.

This was not a surprise, I saw this coming. There are a couple of homeworks and projects that I submitted unfinished. An Although I did redeem myself in the final project (which I was really proud of), I did perform more poorly in the exam than expected. I'm still surprised by  my performance in the exam given that I thought I had a good grasp of the material. Maybe it was burnout, the workload in this class was kind of crazy because projects overlapped with homeworks. I was also working late at work almost every day since I started my new job. By the last month I was just tired and just wanted to be done with it and get some rest. I know, these are just excuses.

My rational self may be wondering why I care so much about a letter grade. That's not what learning is about. This is pure vanity, I hear a voice in the back of my head lament. This is more about a feat that I set out to achieve and failed, than it is about the grade. When I thought about it, I came to the realization that there's something special about maintaining a long-term streak. It's probably not that different from winning back-to-back championships in sports, or staying at the top of your game year after year without losing a beat. It takes only one average performance to kill the streak, or just one episode when your resolve is weakened, or your mental guard is down. So achieving it is impressive. It shows that you were able to maintain a certain level of consistency, resilience, mental resolve and focus to the mission that was sustained over a long period of time, through changing circumstances, different jobs and environments, oscillating moods, etc. No matter what came your way, regardless of how justified you would have been to fail, you still rose to the occasion. I think that's a character-defining feat to accomplish.

Anyway, now that I've failed at that, let me console myself with another bone to chase. It is normal to gain tolerance for something that you previously abhorred once you've tasted it. So maybe I may be tempted to find a B okay in the remaining courses. Well I think it's also a character-defining to reject this temptation and to regain the winning mindset. So yeah, no more B's for me in the remaining 3 courses.
