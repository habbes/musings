# Xaval

On 23rd Feb 2018, a bit over two weeks ago, I started work on a new project: [Xaval](https://github.com/habbes/xaval).

Let me first establish the context. For a while now I have been harboring the desire to design and develop my own
programming language. This why I enrolled in the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/) course on Coursera. One of the
ideas I had is that I'd start with a simple interactive language environment that can be used as fancy calculator
or to experiment with sound or image processing. Actually [LogPi Calc](https://github.com/habbes/logpi-calc) was an early attempt at this when I first learned
about parsers.

I thought I would name this interactive playground environment, powered by my programming language, Waveyard. I thought I would start to work
on it immediately after completing the Nand2Tetris course since it would equip me with a some foundation on designing programming
languages. However since I started the OMSCS program, I have not been able to complete Nand2Tetris yet.

Now that I'm taking a course in Computer Vision, I've found that it would be useful to have an interactive environment where I can quickly experiment with algorithms
and parameters until I get one that works well for my problem. This has rekindled the fire for Waveyard, the fire blazed to the point that I could not resist
devoting a few hours that Friday night to work on it. It was enough to appease me.

I was told that Waveyard is a bad name because it sounds like graveyard. So I renamed the project to Xaval, after my parents Xav√©rine and Alfred.

The idea I currently have for Xaval is to build an interactive playground for image processing and compute vision. To start off, it will be web-based
and powered by Javascript rather than my own programming language. In the long run I do intended to design the language and then embed an interpreter
or something into Xaval. I can start designing the language slowly on the side, as time allows. I also want to allow people to create visual pipelines for their algorithms to make it easier to tweak parameters and see the result immediately without having to modify code.

All I have done so far load up [OpenCv.js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html)
into a simple web page. That's basically the first deploy of the project. I spent most of the first
day learning about Web Assembly, ASM.js and compiling OpenCV to WASM. I haven't touched the project since then. Sigh.

Now, I started to work on this project somewhat prematurely out of impulse. I don't know whether I have the time for it, I already have a priority list. After work, I switch to school work. If I have time beyond that I still have Envoy on my plate. And of course, the Deep Learning course. And let's not forget Nand2Tetris which I still intend to finish. So is this just a resurgence of the habit of spuriously starting projects or courses simultaneously and not completing any? The habit I resolved to overcome last year? At the same time I am really excited about this project. God help me.
