# AI, first impressions

This is the first week of the Artificial Intelligence class, my very first class in the 
[Georgia Tech OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu) program. I have read a bit of the course textbook, 
[Articifical Intelligence, a Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) (AIMA), 
by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. It was quite mind-opening to read about
the foundations and history of AI and to see just how broad the field is and how
many thought-provoking ideas and questions and it has brought to light.

It's interesting to think that this area that has become quite the buzzword
today has been there since the early days of Computer Science. Of course by now
I have come to appreciate the fact that many of the interesting techniques, 
algorithms and methodologies that I come accross in CS have been there since
the 40's, 50's and 60's.

I was also surprised to learn that throughout its development, the field of AI has
experienced a series of booms and winters. I thought the boom that AI, ML and related
fields are currently experiencing is a recent phenomenon. Could it be a repeating
cycle?

It seems that since the early days of AI, there were still debates and questions
about whether machines could really be intelligent, whether we could really
build agents that think or that can achieve things that previously seemed reserved
to humans and there has been this long-standing idea of "intelligent" agents.

I am not sure what exactly it means to be intelligent. But then again, I wonder whether it actually
matters. If a car can drive itself in a busy city without any accidents and performing
better than humans at this task, does it really matter whether we think of it as
intelligent or not? I think that's quite philosphical and not necessarily a relevant
goal for AI. But then again, what do I know?

Now people are debating about whether AI will one day surpass human intelligence, and there is
something about singularity. I do not know much about the field at this point,
but I would say, if we end up creating something
"smarter" than us or that will take over us, we are either really smart or
really stupid. But we keep on getting smarter overtime, building on the advancements
of previous generations. So with we'll probably keep coming up with more and more 
amazing things as times goes by, but hopefully not our own doom.
