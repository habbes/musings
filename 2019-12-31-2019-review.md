# 2019 review

As the end of 2019 approaches, I thought it would be great to list down some of the things that I learned, accomplished and failed to accomplish.

## Things learned

While taking the Big Data for Health course in Spring 2019, I got a formal introduction to the tools and systems used in the space, like Hadoop and Spark. I went to learn more about how such tools were designed and built by reading their papers and this sparked a great interest in systems programming and storage systems.

In the same course, my grasp of deep learning improved and I worked on my first major hands-on project. However, my understanding was put to great question when I participated in the Deep Learning Indaba, which made me realized just how little I know.

Following my growing interest in systems programming, I took an advanced OS course where I learned a great deal about operating systems, distributed systems, parallel systems and related challenges. I read a number of papers in the process.

I also learned the following programming languages and libraries:
- Scala (I haven't used it since the Big Data course and I have probably forgotten it)
- PyTorch
- C
- C++ (still need much more practice to get the hang of the C++11 and later features)
- C# and .Net

## Manuscript

Compared to previous years, especially 2018, this was a rather productive year for Manuscript, all things considered. We managed to re-purpose the old Surix system into a database-as-a-service MVP by mid-year. Based on the feedback we received, we concluded that this was not the right product to build. We then decided to put more focus on data analytics instead of database features. We produced a second MVP which received more positive feedback, albeit no promising leads.

One of our goals for this year was to figure out the product we should build. I believe we have at least narrowed it down now to a self-service BI platform that does not require SQL or programming skills. More like Metabase, and less like Firebase. This is not all we intended to achieve by end of the year, but it's good progress.

## Projects

- Detecting diseases from X-ray images using DNNs (project from the Big Data course)
- VM CPU and memory manager based on libvirt (project from the AOS course)
- [Simple spreadsheet](https://github.com/habbes/spreadsheet) (used as a reference project for HURIDOCS software developer job candidates)
- MapReduce clone (project from AOS course)

## Career

I left HURIDOCS late this year and joined Microsoft. It was a difficult and emotional decision to make. The main reason it was difficult was because of the people there, especially Jaume, the CTO. I learned a lot from him.

However, it was also time for me to move to something else. I felt like my career revolved too much around web development and I wanted to explore more of what CS has to offer. The stuff I worked on at HURIDOCS are not that much different from the development work I do on Surix. From a learning perspective, it felt a bit too redundant.

Importantly, I wanted to take control of my career progression and to steer it in the direction I wanted it to go, to get exposed to things I want to learn and experience, as opposed to having my career led primarily by opportunities that came my way. Working remotely was also becoming less attractive and motivating for me. The money may or may not have been an additional motivator to make the switch.

## Shortcomings

It really sucks that, yet again, Manuscript did not manage to get a single user for Surix, or even one person to commit to using it when it's ready and officially launched. So we're still in the dark, so to speak, building a product without concrete customer validation.

I regret that I fell trap to tutorial hell, taking yet another deep learning course, instead of working on a hands-on project or challenge. I don't know when next I'll get time to correct this, given that next year my focus will probably be on systems programming, or compilers.
