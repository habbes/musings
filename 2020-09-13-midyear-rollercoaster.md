# Midyear Rollercoaster

The period between June and early September was a serious rollercoaster. I remember [complaining that I lost my A streak and got my first B](./2020-05-10-omscs-end-of-a-streak.md). I resolved to not get another B in the remainder of the master program. But the Summer semester had other plans.

I went through a terrible heartbreak following a devastating break-up. This affected my performance at school and at worked. I got an F early in my High Performance Computer Architecture class. After deciding not to drop the class and to work throughout, I just went on survival mode and ended up pulling through with a B. It's not what I hoped for going in, but given the circumstances, I'll take it!

This period wasn't all that bad though. I got a promoted a work. I led a project during the company-wide hackathon. And now I'm tasked with leading efforts to "productionize" that service.

We finally managed to take Social Relief live (https://socialrelief.co). It was great to finally see this project come to life after all the bottlenecks that made its future seem bleak. That said, there's still a lot of work to do to roll it out to the general public.

I also finally moved out to my own place.

Coming into the new semester, I was exhausted and burned out. My work performance has still not been optimal. I've been a shadow of the who I was at the beginning of the year. I contemplated skipping the Fall semester or take an easier course instead of the Into to High Performance Computing course that I had planned to take. I decided to proceed with IHPC as planned. I didn't really watch lectures or course material in the first 2-3 weeks of the course. I told my self I was on a mental break. But I made sure to submit the first assignment before the deadline.

Now I need to get my groove back. Time for this sub-optimal performance and slacking off to end. Tomorrow I hope to pick up the pace and get back to my driven, motivated self, catch up and get things done.

Despite the slump, heartaches, burnout and disappointments, when taking everything into account, I think this period has been a win!
