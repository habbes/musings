# musings

I have for long ignored the urge and prudence to put into writing the different thoughts and ideas that every once in
a while form raging torrents in my mind.

I have finally decided to submit to that voice that urged me to start writing things down and keeping a record of things,
to better understand, analyse and develop my own thoughts and ideas, to clear my working memory for new thoughts,
for future reference and maybe even for posterity.

So this will now serve as my journal of thoughts.
