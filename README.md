# musings

I have for long ignored the urge and prudence to put into writing the different thoughts and ideas that every once in
a while form raging torrents in my mind.

I have now decided to listen to that voice that urged me to start writing and keeping a record of things,
to better understand and analyse my own thoughts, to clear my working memory for new thoughts,
for future reference and posterity.

So this will now serve as my journal of thoughts.
