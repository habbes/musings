# Foray into deep learning

Yesterday my group submitted our final project for the [Big Data for Health Informatics class (OMSCS CSE6250)](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cse-8803-special-topics-big-data-for-health-informatics).
Our project involved training a deep-learning model on the [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) dataset in order to detect diseases in chest X-rays.

The course covered a lot of topics in big data analytics and I got the chance to get some hands-on exposure to a some big data tools and machine learning techniques. Deep Learning only covered the last third of the course. I planned to use this opportunity to get that hands-on experience in deep learning that I had been craving. I was excited to take up a practical project, and especially a group project. I was looking to learn a few things from a team mate more experienced than I was.

I had a lof of expectations for my project. I was hoping to do it well, to read a lot, experiment a lot. I wanted to gain the proper intuitions, to understand why a network behaves the way it does, to know when I need to tweak which hyper parameters and how, to know whether I should add a few more fully-connected layers, wether it makes a different to 10 nodes or 50 in some layer, whether to add dropout and which networks to add it to, etc. these questions that always mystified me about neural networks I thought I'd figure them out. I hoped we would submit our model to the CheXpert competition and beat the current baseline. I heard students with good reports would be invited to some conference to present their work. I wanted that to be us.

After submitting the work, the sigh of relief after spending a couple of sleepless nights was accompanied by some air of disappointment. We were that disciplined in our work most of the time, the final report is not stellar, our final results aren't that satisfactory (still waiting to see where we land on the leader board). I don't feel like I gained all the intuitions and insights I hoped I would. A lot of the things still mystify me. Also, my team mates seemed to struggle just as much or more than I did and had the same last-minute tendencies as me.

But given this was my first deep learning project, my expectations were unrealistic. I have gained a few things, too: built a habit of reading different papers and trying out their ideas, learned PyTorch, implemented a deep learning project, had experience in debugging GPU memory errors, appreciated how hardware limitations can restrict which architectures are feasible and force some tradeoffs, demystified a few concepts and intimidating buzzwords in deep learning like CNNs, RNNs, style transfer, detection and segmentation, transfer learning, popular network architectures etc. As a beginner, I think I'm on the right track.

Since I'm not taking a class in the Summer term, I'm going to use part of the time to learn more and practice more in this field. I've seen an interesting competition on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/farm-pin-crop-detection-challenge) that I could try out. But silly me is already eyeing the first prize. I never learn...
