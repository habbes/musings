# 2020 Learning Plan

I started my masters aiming to specialize in AI and machine learning. Since I took the Big Data course last year and discovering data engineering platforms, my interest in storage systems and systems programming shot up. This interest was reinforced when I took the Advanced OS course last year and Compilers course this year. While I did enjoy the introductory AI courses where you get to implement algorithms, when it came to applying ML and DL, it felt less like I was building systems and more like I was tweaking parameters in a trial-and-error fashion. But safe to say, I came to realize I didn't like that aspect of ML that much. I think I just didn't have the patience the get the right intuition for it.

I've decided that systems programming is where I want to really get good at. By the time I'm 30, I want to have some solid  expertise in systems programming, as well as solidify my foundational knowledge in computer science and software engineering and close some gaps. To that end, I will create annual learning plans that will get me to that goal.

This is my plan for this year:

- Gain in-depth knowledge of C# language, the .Net platform and related ecosystem, including:
    - language internals
    - C# compiler, IL, CLR, JIT compilers
    - memory layout,garbage collection
    - threading, concurrency, parallelism
    - unsafe code and native interop
    - debugging tools, profiling tools, WinDbg, SOS, etc.
    - performance tuning

I have been reading and taking courses in such topics and will continue to do so. I also intend to work on side-projects in C# for learning purposes.

- Gain confidence in C++. I learned C last year and tried to pick up C++ thereafter. But  I realized that C++ is a whole different beast and I'm constantly questioning evry line of code I write. My confidence has improved especially since I used C++ a lot in the compilers course. I intend to use C++ in the remaining courses where applicable. I also think it might be interesting to experiment with C++ components in Node.js, maybe learn how V8 works, etc. That why I also learn more about Node.js and JavaScript since I use them a lot.  I hope that by the end of the year I will be able to call myself a C++ programmer without feeling like a fraud.

- Performance tuning and benchmarking. I want to learn how to properly benchmark programs and learn tips and techniques of investigating performance issues and improving overall performance of a system. I plan on taking high performance architecture and HPC courses this year. I also plan to run benchmarking and performance tuning experiments in C# on my free time or as part of my day job.

- OS fundamentals. I'll continue to read the book "OS Three Easy Pieces" whenever I get the chance. I'll finish when I finish. I have no fixed timeline for this one.
